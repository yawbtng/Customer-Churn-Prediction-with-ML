    "## Machine Learning Task Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Type: Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Predict customer churn probability as a continuous value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Formulation\n",
    "- **Input**: Customer features (CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.)\n",
    "- **Output**: Churn probability (continuous value from 0 to 1)\n",
    "- **Goal**: Minimize prediction error for churn probability estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for Regression Approach\n",
    "While customer churn is inherently binary (churned vs. stayed), we choose regression for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Probability Estimation**: Regression allows us to predict the probability of churn, providing more nuanced insights than binary classification\n",
    "2. **Business Value**: Banks can prioritize customers based on churn probability scores for targeted retention campaigns\n",
    "3. **Risk Assessment**: Continuous probability scores enable better risk stratification and resource allocation\n",
    "4. **Model Flexibility**: Regression models can be easily thresholded for binary decisions while maintaining probabilistic interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Metrics\n",
    "- **Primary**: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\n",
    "- **Secondary**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R² Score\n",
    "- **Business**: Ability to identify high-risk customers for retention efforts\n"
